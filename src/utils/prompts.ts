export const limitGenerationPrompt = `
Based on the above description, generate a JSON object with the following format that identifies variables and limits:

1. The "variables" section should include:
   - A variable name as the key.
   - Each variable should have the following attributes:
     - "type" (the kind of data structure, such as array, integer, string, etc.)
     - "dataType" (the type of data it holds, such as integer, string, boolean, etc.)
     - "description" (a brief explanation of what the variable represents).

2. The "limits" section should define constraints on the variables:
   - A key that represents a specific constraint (e.g., array length, element values).
   - Each limit should include:
     - "limit" (the constraint condition, like \`>= 2\`, a range of values like \`[-1000, 1000]\`, etc.)
     - "description" (a brief explanation of the constraint).
     - "variables" (the name(s) of the variable(s) to which the limit is applied).

Please separate input and output variables.

export const generatorPrompt = `
You are a Python developer tasked with writing a script to automatically generate valid test cases based on the following criteria:

1. The user has provided the following natural language description:
{naturalLanguage}

2. The user has also specified the following limits for the variables involved:
{limit}

### Objective:
Write a Python script that will generate valid test cases based on the given input and limits. The script should:
- Generate only valid test cases that comply with the provided constraints.
- Ensure that all the variables respect the specified limits.
- Include functions that generate valid values for each variable according to the given limits.

### Expected Output:
The Python script should include:
- A function named generator that generates valid test cases for each variable. This function should return a dictionary containing the generated values.
- The main function should call the generator function exactly once and return its result in json format.
- Proper comments and documentation explaining how the test case generation works.

export const validatorPrompt = `
You are a Python developer tasked with writing a script to validate user input based on the following criteria:

The user has provided the following variables and limits for the validation:
{
    "variables": {variables},
    "limits": {limits}
}

Write a Python function that validates input provided as a JSON string via stdin. The JSON input will contain arbitrary variable names and values of arbitrary types, but it will follow this structure:

{"variable1": value1, "variable2": value2, ...}

Your task:
1. Parse the JSON input, recognizing that the variable names may vary.
2. Use kwargs to dynamically pass the extracted variables to the validation function.

Each validation function should:
    - Return True if the input is valid according to the limits.
    - Return False if the input is invalid.
    - Raise exceptions or return an error message if the input is out of bounds.

Ensure the code is well-commented and easy to understand.
`

export const checkerPrompt = `
You are a Python developer tasked with creating a checker function to validate the user's output against the given input and specified conditions. Your task is to write a Python function that:

1. Takes two parameters:
   - 'input_data': A dictionary containing the input values.
   - 'user_output': The output provided by the user's solution.

2. Checks if the user_output meets all the specified conditions based on the input_data and the problem requirements.

3. Returns a tuple containing:
   - A boolean indicating whether the output is valid (True) or not (False).
   - A string message explaining the result of the check. If the output is invalid, this message should describe why.

Additionally, you should write a **main function** that:

1. Reads the input data and user output from standard input in JSON format.
2. Calls the check_solution function.
3. Prints the result in a structured way.

### Here is the problem statement in natural language:

{problem}

### Here are the specific requirements and conditions to check:

{conditions}

### Write two Python functions:

1. A function named check_solution that performs the validation checks as described above.
2. A main function that reads the input and output data in JSON format, calls the check_solution function, and prints the result.

Hereâ€™s a template to get you started:

import json

def check_solution(input_data, user_output):
    """
    Check if the user's output meets all specified conditions.
    
    Args:
    input_data (dict): A dictionary containing the input values.
    user_output: The output provided by the user's solution.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: (is_valid, message)
        is_valid (bool): True if the output is valid, False otherwise.
        message (str): A description of the check result.
    """
    # Your checking logic here
    # ...

    return is_valid, message

def main():
    """
    Main function to handle JSON input and output.
    """
    # Read input from stdin
    input_json = input()
    
    # Parse the input JSON
    data = json.loads(input_json)
    
    input_data = data['input']
    user_output = data['output']
    
    # Call the check_solution function
    is_valid, message = check_solution(input_data, user_output)
    
    # Print the result
    result = {
        "is_valid": is_valid,
        "message": message
    }
    
    print(json.dumps(result))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

### Example:

Input JSON via stdin:

{
  "input": {"nums": [1, 2, 3], "target": 4},
  "output": [0, 2]
}

Expected Output:

{
  "is_valid": true,
  "message": "The user's output matches the expected result."
}
